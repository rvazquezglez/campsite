[introduction]
== Introduction
An underwater volcano formed a new small island in the Pacific Ocean last month. All the conditions on the island seems perfect and it was
decided to open it up for the general public to experience the pristine uncharted territory.
The island is big enough to host a single campsite so everybody is very excited to visit. In order to regulate the number of people on the island, it
was decided to come up with an online web application to manage the reservations.

This REST API service manages the campsite reservations. In general all endpoints are open to anyone there's no restriction on them.

== Getting availability
Before booking you need to find out when the campsite is available. This endpoint will tell you which dates are already booked.

=== Parameters for getting availability
If parameters are not provided the date range is 1 month by default.

== Booking a Reservation
To get a successful reservation there are a couple of rules:

- The campsite can be reserved for max 3 days.
- The campsite can be reserved minimum 1 day(s) ahead of arrival and up to 1 month in advance.

The booking endpoint uses an http `POST` method.
